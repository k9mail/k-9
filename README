Current K9 sources from git require SDK AI level 16, so the properties
files needed to be updated to Android SDK API level 16 instead of
15.

There are three imports that need to be done to add this to
eclipse. It's also possible to use 'ant' if your build.xml 
files are correct. You can set those up with the correct build path
using this command from the top level directory:

      android update project --path `pwd` --subprojects

The first two projects to import are libraries, which are
ActionBarSherlock and Android-PullToRefresh. These import weird, so
after they get imported as 'library', rename them. 

To build, use eclipse or type 'ant debug' at the top level. To install
the package, it must first be removed, do that like this:
    
    adb install -r bin/k9-mail.apk
